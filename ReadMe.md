# Quick Repository (also works for ubuntu:latest docker container from dockerhub.com):

apt-get update
apt-get install -y build-essential ruby ruby-dev sudo wget

wget http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj_bootstrap
& If you have no write access to this repository:
ruby autoproj_bootstrap git https://github.com/H2020-InFuse/cdff-buildconf.git branch=cdff_dev
& If you have write access:
ruby autoproj_bootstrap git git@github.com:H2020-InFuse/cdff-buildconf.git branch=cdff_dev
& Answer "whether C++11 should be enabled for Rock packages [false]" with "true" and the
& other with default (just hit enter)

source env.sh
autoproj update
autoproj build

# Infuse framework install instructions

Execute the following to get the infuse framework ready to use on your machine.

    Create a folder and move into it

    Download the autoproj bootstrap script

    $ wget http://www.rock-robotics.org/autoproj_bootstrap

    Run the boostrap script and provide the repository address

    $ ruby autoproj_bootstrap git git@gitlab.spaceapplications.com:InFuse/cdff-buildconf branch=cdff_dev

    Append branch=cdff_dev if you want to install CDFF and CDFF-dev. Remove it if you only want to install CDFF.

    Answer the autoproj_bootstrap questions. Defaults are usually OK (just hit enter), except for:

    whether C++11 should be enabled for Rock packages [false]

    There you type 'true' and hit enter.

    Source your InFuse environment

    $ source env.sh

    Update the checkout

    $ autoproj update

    Answer the questions. Defaults are ok again. If it went fine, you should see a message similar to:

    Command finished successfully at 2018-04-09 15:13:05 +0200

    Compile the Sources

    $ autoproj build

    If it went fine, you should see a message similar to:

    Command finished successfully at 2018-04-10 03:13:37 +0200
    
   # Uninstalling
   Autoproj also may have installed OS dependencies, but autoproj cannot decide whether those are still needed or not, they cannot be automatically uninstalled. To see which packages were installed, please look at the install/logs/autoptoj-osdeps.log file for a complete list.

Autoproj itself (and it's ruby dependencies) is installed to the user folder ~/.autoproj

Autoproj installes all source packages to a local a folder called "install" in the base folder (i.e. where you executed autoproj_bootstrap).

Just delete these folders to uninstall.
# Expert Options: Configuration of your autoproj build
# CMake

Since everything is CMake based, environment variables such as CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH are always picked up. You can set them in init.rb too, which will copy them to your env.sh script.

Because of cmake's aggressive caching behaviour, manual options given to cmake will be overriden by autoproj later on. To make such options permanent, add

package('package_name').define "OPTION", "VALUE"

in overrides.rb. For instance, to set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for the rtt package, do

package('rtt').define "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE", "Debug"

# Files in the autoproj/ directory

The autoproj/ directory (this directory) contains the files and configuration that defines the whole build.

manifest: Simple key-value pair file in the YAML format. It lists sources for "package sets", other autoproj configuration directories in which packages have been declared for you to reuse (package_sets section). It also lists the packages that you actually want to build (layout section)

remotes/: contains a checkout of the package sets listed in the manifest. You should not have to go in there unless you are yourself developing a package set.

config.yml: Autoproj can be parametrized by build options. This file is where your previous choices for these options are saved. You should not change it manually. If you need to change an option, run autoproj reconfigure

overrides.yml: Simple key-value pair file in the YAML format. It allows to override branch information for specific packages. Most people leave this to the default, unless they want to use a feature from an experimental branch. See the following page for a description of its contents. http://www.rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/autoproj/advanced/importers.html

init.rb: Ruby script that contains customization code that will get executed before autoproj is loaded.

overrides.rb: Ruby script that contains customization code that will get executed after autoproj is loaded, but before the build starts.
