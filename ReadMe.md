## Quick Instructions
First of all we need to Install MARS Environment:
     
We need to perform the following steps without usings sudo (To avoid generating files and folders owned by root)
Now Open The Terminal or Command Prompt and follow the following steps step-by-step:

1) Basic Initial Steps: 
      
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y build-essential ruby ruby-dev sudo wget
          
2) Download the autoproj bootstrap script:
      
    wget http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj_bootstrap
          
    
3) Run the boostrap script and provide the repository address:

The user has to set up his/her keys in the github and gitlab account and use the correspondent command:
      
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap git git@github.com:jura02/simulation-buildconf.git branch=envireMars          
 
If the user has not generated the SSH key in his/her github and gitlab account then use the correspondent command: 
    
    ruby autoproj_bootstrap git https://github.com/jura02/simulation-buildconf.git branch=envireMars
        

Answer "whether C++11 should be enabled for Rock packages [false]" with "true" and the other with default (just hit enter)    
    
4) Source Your Environment: 
      
    source env.sh
      
5) Check Out Updates:
      
    autoproj update
          
6) Build Your Environment:
      
    autoproj build        
    
This step will start building everything.
    
7) Check for instance that mars_app is installed. To launch the mars application: 

    mars_app          
    

In mars_app you can load different environments and robots of your chioce.
    
 ## TroubleShooting Section:
 
1- No Access Right:

Sometimes you may face the problems like "No Access Rights to your repository": Make sure you have corrected generated the SSH Key for both GitLab and GitHub
    
Similarly, sometimes you don't have access to the specific Repository forexample:
"No Access Rights to git@git.hb.dfki.de/models-environments" 
In this case, you have to make an access request to the maintainer/owner of that Repository. 

2- PROGRAM STUCKS AFTER ENTERING ` autoproj update `

If you are on step NO:05 and your program got stuck while checking out Models Environment and Models Robots. 

You can checkout each robot/environment separately to overcome this problem.

Let say  we need to install spacebot_cup robot.
Todo so use:
    
    autoproj update models/environments/spacebot_cup
              
Similarly do same for all the other robots like asguard_v4 etc.

    
3- AFTER ENTERING ` autoproj build `.

Maybe you get an error "CMake fails to compile the simple test".
There are two possibilites to overcome this problem: 

First of all install build essential using the correspondent command:
    
    sudo apt install build-essential
              
If you are still having the same error, then you can try by removing ccache. The default configuration does not use ccache but sometimes errors are triggered if it installed but not selected for use. You can remove ccache with

     apt-get remove ccache
